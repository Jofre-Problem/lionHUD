How to install custom hitsounds:

((Delete your previous hitsounds, if applicable))

1) Create a folder named "sound" in the following directory:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\[LIONHUD DIRECTORY]\

2) Create another folder inside of "sound" named "ui"
	
3) Choose your favorite hit/killsounds and drop them in that folder.

Feel free to mix and match! All you have to do is rename any of the files.

•hitsound.wav is for your hitsound
